### What is Orbit.M?

Orbit.M is an open-source easy-to-use orbit maintenance simulator and propulsion sizing tool for anyone and anywhere! It is a software with a graphical user interface where you can fill in your orbital parameters, satellite masses, satellite areas, drag parameters, and the software will compute your desired Delta-V necessary for the mission depending on your choice of thruster (based on the Isp). For beginners who are not familiar with the terms "Delta-V" and "Isp", the Wikipedia articles about them, below, do a fantastic job of explaining what they are.

[WikiPedia article on Delta-V.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v)
[WikiPedia article on Specific Impulse, or Isp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_impulse)

Once you input your orbit and satellite parameters, the software will output a mission Delta-V profile against the Isp of your thruster choices, as well as an altitude and mean semi-major axis chart.

### How do I use Orbit.M?

The software can be run as long as your Python comes with TKinter, NumPy, Matplotlib, and among other very standard Python libraries. If you do not have Python, I recommend using the [Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/), and running it on Spyder 4 simply because that's what I'm using right now.

The software can be started by running the Python file **orbitm.py** in the main directory (which is equivalent to the directory you see on the master branch on ORBITM's github page). You can select to use
